Project Title
Development of a YouTube Analytics and Insight Dashboard for Channel Performance Evaluation and Engagement Analysis
1. Product Overview & Context
This project focuses on building an end-to-end YouTube analytics and insight platform that transforms raw channel data into actionable intelligence for creators, marketers, and analysts.
Most creators today can see metrics but cannot interpret them meaningfully. Existing tools emphasize surface-level statistics, leaving users to rely on intuition rather than evidence-backed strategy.
This product bridges that gap by:
Structuring channel and video data into analyzable formats
Identifying performance patterns, trends, and anomalies
Translating analytics into clear growth, engagement, and content insights
The platform is designed to be exploratory, comparative, and decision-oriented, enabling users to evaluate both individual channel health and competitive positioning within a genre.
2. Project Statement & Intended Outcomes
